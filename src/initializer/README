Initializer v 0.4

###############

Description:

Sets up initial particle positions and velocities for a given cosmology. 
Code roughly follows MC2 pattern; several departures are made to make the code 
running about 8X faster, using 8X less memory than the original version. 
It's C/C++/MPI, and parallel scaling should be determined by the FFT.
1_to_3 D transformation is applied to transfer data into cubes, as 
we currently only have 1D FFT (FFTW) available.

###############

Compiling:

Should need only to set desired compilers and flags in the makefile. 
FFTW has to be linked, supported are both FFTW 2 and 3 versions. See the 
header of the Makefile for additional flags and explanations...

###############

Running:

mpirun -np X init <indatName> <tfName> <outBase>

<indatName> is the name of the indat file (see important change regarding the 
                                           transfer function below!!)

<tfName> is the name of the transfer function file (see cmb.tf)

<outBase> is the base for output name, actual files will have ".X" appended,
where X is the mpi rank, one file per mpi rank

It is possible to run on one processor with -np 1. Serial run case is treated 
separately throughout the code, so that can be done as well...

###############

Sources:

There are 2 C files:
      PerfMon.c
      distribution.c
6 C++ files:
      Initializer.cpp
      Cosmology.cpp
      DataBase.cpp
      MT_Random.cpp
      Parallelization.cpp
      main.cpp
and 9 header files. 

###############

Input:
      cmb.tf  -- needed only if CMBFAST trasfer function is used
      indat   -- input parameters (always needed)

indat:
      In indat one should specify cosmology (see the example file 
      provided), and run parameters. The file is taken from MC2 and 
      most of parameters listed are actually unused in the initializer. 
      
      IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE MC2 INDAT FILE:

      Transfer function: 0=CMBFast, 1=KH, 2=HS, 3=PD, 4=BBKS
                                CMB for CMBFAST trasfer function
                                BBKS for Bardeen et al. 1986, ApJ 304, 15
                                PD for Peacock & Dodds, 1994, MNRAS, 267, 1020
                                HS for Hu & Sugiyama, 1996, ApJ, 471, 542
                                KH for Klypin & Holtzman, astro-ph/9712217

      Domain decomposition: should be kept as 1 for now, as only FFTW
                            exists for now; data is transfered into
                            cubes at the very end, by calling David's
                            distribution.c

###############

Output:

Particles are directed to the position and velocity arrays, and example 
main.cpp showcase the calling of the initializer code. There, Adrian also 
provided example output (parallel, binary) in cosmo format, where positions 
are in Mpc/h, velocities in km/s.
