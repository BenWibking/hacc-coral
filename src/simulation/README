pm_par_opt = Particle-Mesh Parallel Opteron

this code has the same type size flexibility as the halo_finder code.
modify the "HF_TYPE_FLAGS" to change type sizes, eg change -ID_32 to
-ID_64 for 8 byte particle IDs (necessary if np >~ 1280) instead of 4 byte.
if any of the types are set to be 8 bytes, then the input and output files
will be like .(h)cosmo formatted files, except that the columns will be
8 bytes instead of 4 bytes for those columns that have had their type
size changed.

USAGE: mc3 <indat> <inBase> <outBase> RECORD|BLOCK|COSMO ROUND_ROBIN|ONE_TO_ONE

indat: input parameter file name

inBase: base for initial condition file names; code searches for all
"inBase.*" files as initial condition files.

outBase: base for output file names; output file names will be "outBase.X"
where "X" is an mpi rank, one output file per rank.

RECORD: .hcosmo
BLOCK: gadget2
COSMO: .cosmo

ROUND_ROBIN: all particles are passed to all ranks to get alive particles
ONE_TO_ONE: particles in files are correctly decomposed

note: the indat format has been altered to agree with the initializer.
dark energy equation of state is now the second to last parameter and
overload length is the last.  see the example.
